🚀 From Dev to QA (…or at least trying)

📖 About this Repo
I’m a developer who wants to experience life as a QA tester but… still a dev at heart. ❤️
So, I created this FizzBuzz testing practice with GitLab CI/CD to see what it feels like to:
✅ Write tests for my own code
✅ Set up Automated & Manual Testing
✅ Pretend I enjoy breaking my own work

💡 What’s Inside?
A FizzBuzz implementation in TypeScript 🏗️

GitLab CI/CD pipeline with:
🔹 Build & Test stage (with Jest)
🔹 Manual Testing stage (because some bugs are just too sneaky)
🔹 A fake Deploy stage (for now)

👀 Why This Exists?
Because one day, I woke up and thought:
"What if I stopped writing bugs and started finding them instead?"
…And now I’m here. 🤷‍♂️
